# Contributing to The DevOps Decision Kit

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This repo gets better when practitioners share their real decisions.

## How to Contribute

### Report a Scenario
If the decision trees do not cover your situation, open an issue with the scenario request template. Describe your team size, budget, stack, and what you need to decide.

### Share Your Decision Outcome
Used a tree and deployed? Open an issue with the decision feedback template. Tell us what you chose, why, and what happened. Real-world feedback makes the trees more accurate.

### Submit a Case Study
If you have 6+ months of production data after using a Decision Kit recommendation, we would love to include your case study (anonymized if needed).

### Fix Errors
Found outdated pricing, broken templates, or factual mistakes? PRs welcome.

## Guidelines
- Keep decision tree contributions evidence-based. Cite real production experience, not theoretical preferences.
- Template contributions must include an annotated README explaining every significant configuration choice.
- Be specific. "Terraform is better" is not a contribution. "Terraform was better for our 5-person team because of X, Y, Z" is.
