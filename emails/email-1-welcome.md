# Email 1: Welcome / Delivery

**Subject**: Your From 1 to Prod repo is ready -- start with Module 1 this weekend
**Send**: Day 0 (immediately after signup)
**Single job**: Get them to clone the repo and start Module 1

Hey --

Welcome to From 1 to Prod. Here's what you just signed up for: a progressive capstone that takes you from Linux fundamentals to production Kubernetes with one real app.

**Start here:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peleke/from-1-to-prod.git
git checkout 01-linux
```

Module 1 (Linux Fundamentals) takes 4-6 hours. By the end, you'll have a working dev environment with proper SSH config, file permissions, and process management. It sounds basic. It IS basic. That's the point -- "to them a linux distribution is synonymous with a docker base image" is the hiring manager complaint that Module 1 exists to kill.

Open the README in the `01-linux` branch. Follow the steps. Run the tests (`make test`) to validate each milestone.

Over the next week, I'll send you 4 more emails:
- Day 2: A quick win you can use at work immediately
- Day 4: The deploy that taught me why fundamentals matter
- Day 6: The honest answer to "is this really different from another course?"
- Day 7: Where builders like you go to get unstuck

Hit reply if you have any questions. I read every response.
