Hey,

Your Decision Kit just landed. Here is your download link:

**[Download The DevOps Decision Kit]({download_link})**

Here is how to get value from this in the next 10 minutes:

1. Open the **Quick Start: Your First Decision in 15 Minutes** (Section 1).
2. Answer the four questions: team size, monthly cloud budget, primary cloud provider, existing codebase language.
3. Follow the arrow to your recommendation.

By the time you finish your coffee, you will have a specific, defensible answer to "what should we use?" for at least one infrastructure layer. That is the whole point -- you stop Googling and start deciding.

The kit has 5 decision trees covering IaC tools, container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring stacks, and an AI-generated infrastructure review checklist. You do not need to read them all at once. Start with whatever decision is staring you down this week.

Over the next 7 days, I am going to send you a few emails:

- Day 2: A specific technique from the kit you can use immediately
- Day 4: A production war story that explains why one of the sections exists
- Day 6: An honest answer to the biggest doubt you might have about this approach
- Day 7: What I am building next for engineers like you

Each email has one idea. No sales pitches, no filler.

Go open that Quick Start.

P.S. The companion GitHub repo is here: **[{repo_link}]**. It has deployable Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD templates that match each decision path in the kit. Clone it alongside the guide.
