# Email Sequence: The DevOps Decision Kit

Post-purchase nurture sequence. 5 emails over 7 days.

## Timing Map

| Email | Day | Subject | Job |
|-------|-----|---------|-----|
| 1 | 0 (immediate) | Your DevOps Decision Kit is ready -- open the Quick Start first | Deliver product, create momentum |
| 2 | 2 | Try this the next time someone asks "should we use Kubernetes?" | Get them a concrete win |
| 3 | 4 | The deploy that mass-deleted production records at Qortex | Build trust through shared experience |
| 4 | 6 | "Can't I just ask ChatGPT which tool to use?" | Address the #1 post-purchase doubt |
| 5 | 7 | Building something for engineers who make infrastructure decisions alone | Community intent signal / feedback request |

## Voice Notes

- Practitioner-to-practitioner. You are an engineer writing to an engineer.
- Each email has ONE job. Do not cram multiple CTAs.
- Subject lines are specific to the email content. No generic "Hey!" or "Quick update."
- Sign off as "-- Peleke" (not "Best regards" or "Cheers").

## Platform

Designed for ConvertKit or Buttondown. Trigger automation on purchase tag. Set delays between emails as noted above.
