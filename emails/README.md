# Email Sequence: From 1 to Prod

5-email post-signup nurture sequence. Tone: practitioner-to-practitioner. Each email has ONE job.

## Sequence Overview

| Email | Subject | Send | Job |
|-------|---------|------|-----|
| 1 | Your From 1 to Prod repo is ready -- start with Module 1 this weekend | Day 0 | Get them to clone and start Module 1 |
| 2 | Try this with your next CI/CD debug -- takes 5 minutes | Day 2 | Give a quick win they can use at work |
| 3 | The deploy that taught me why Kubernetes isn't always the answer | Day 4 | Build credibility through shared experience |
| 4 | You might be wondering if this is really different from another course | Day 6 | Eliminate the #1 post-signup doubt |
| 5 | Where builders like you go to get unstuck | Day 7 | Convert to Skool community member |

## Voice Notes

- Write like an engineer talking to another engineer
- No marketing speak, no fake urgency, no countdown timers
- Every email should be valuable even if they never join the community
- Subject lines are specific to what's inside, not clickbait
