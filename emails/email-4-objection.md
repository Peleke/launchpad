Fair question. Let me be honest.

Here's what this is NOT:
- Not a video series (there are no videos)
- Not a certification prep guide (there are no quizzes)
- Not a tool tutorial (you don't learn Docker in isolation)

Here's what it IS:
- A repo you clone
- With branches you check out
- And code you actually write and deploy
- With tests that tell you if you did it right

The difference isn't the content. The difference is the structure.

Every DevOps tutorial teaches the same tools. The problem was never "I can't find a Docker tutorial." The problem is "I can't connect Docker to CI/CD to Terraform to monitoring into a coherent production system."

From 1 to Prod is one app, growing through 8 modules. Module 3 containerizes what Module 2 scripted. Module 4 builds a pipeline for what Module 3 containerized. Nothing exists in isolation.

And if I'm wrong -- if you finish Module 4 and DON'T have a working CI/CD pipeline deploying a real app -- open an issue. I'll fix the repo.

That's the guarantee. Not money back. The product getting better.
