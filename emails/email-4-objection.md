Hey,

If you have been sitting on the Decision Kit without using it, there is a good chance this thought crossed your mind:

*"Why did I pay for this? I can ask ChatGPT."*

Fair question. Here is the honest answer.

Ask ChatGPT: "Should I use Terraform or Pulumi?" You will get something like: "Terraform is great for multi-cloud declarative infrastructure. Pulumi is great if your team prefers general-purpose languages. It depends on your use case."

That is a comparison. It is not a decision.

Now open the IaC Decision Tree in the kit (Section 2). It asks you three things: your team size (solo, small, enterprise), your team's existing programming language skills (Python? TypeScript? Neither?), and whether you need multi-cloud.

If you are a solo engineer with a Python background deploying to AWS only, the tree tells you: **use Pulumi with Python. Here is why. Here is the starter template. Here is when to reconsider.**

ChatGPT gave you a menu. The Decision Kit gave you an order.

The difference matters because the thing that keeps engineers stuck is not lack of information -- you have been reading comparison posts for weeks. The thing that keeps you stuck is that nobody will tell you what to do given YOUR specific situation. AI gives you options. A decision framework that accounts for team size, budget, existing skills, and cloud provider gives you an answer.

That said, AI is a phenomenal tool when you know what you are building. Section 6 of the kit (the "Should I Use AI for This?" Checklist) is specifically designed for that: once you have DECIDED what to build, here is how to use Copilot to build it safely.

The framework decides. AI executes. That is the workflow.

Go open the section that matches whatever decision you are facing this week. Answer the questions. Follow the tree. You will have your answer in 15 minutes.

P.S. If you genuinely tried the framework and it did not help you make a decision, reply and tell me where it broke down. I will either point you to the right section or improve the kit based on your feedback. The 30-day guarantee is real.
