# Email 5: Community Invite

**Subject**: Building something for engineers who make infrastructure decisions alone
**Send**: Day 7
**Job**: Collect community intent signal / feedback

Hey,

One thing I have heard from Decision Kit buyers (and from years working in this space) keeps coming up:

*"I am the only DevOps/infrastructure person on my team. I have nobody to sanity-check my decisions against."*

If that is you, you know the feeling. You run through the decision tree, you pick an answer, and then the doubt creeps in: "But what if I'm wrong? There's nobody here to tell me."

Research backs this up. Solo DevOps engineers report that the hardest part is not the technical work -- it is having no peers to brainstorm with. One engineer put it this way: "Multiple areas of responsibility meant that no matter how good you became at one thing, there were other areas that you always felt embarrassingly ignorant about."

I am building a community specifically for engineers in this situation. Not a course platform. Not a certification mill. A place where mid-level DevOps and infrastructure engineers can post a decision, get feedback from practitioners who have been there, and stop making every call alone.

What it will look like:
- Weekly infrastructure decision teardowns (real anonymized decisions from members, discussed as a group)
- A "decision review" channel where you post your tree output and get peer feedback
- Live office hours where you can bring your specific situation

It does not exist yet. I am looking for founding members -- people who would actually show up and participate, not just lurk.

If this sounds like something you would use, reply to this email with one sentence: **what infrastructure decision are you facing right now that you wish you could get a second opinion on?**

That is it. One sentence. I will use the responses to design the community around real problems, not hypothetical ones.

P.S. Whether or not the community happens, the Decision Kit is yours forever. This is not a pitch to buy something else. It is me asking if the thing I want to build next is something you actually need.
