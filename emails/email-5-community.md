You've had the repo for a week.

Maybe you crushed Module 1 and you're in the middle of Module 2. Maybe you starred it and haven't started yet. Maybe you got stuck on the SSH config.

All of that is fine. But here's what I've noticed about learning DevOps solo:

"Solo DevOps is absolute hell." -- u/thatsnotamuffin, r/devops

The repo gives you the path. What it can't give you is:
- Someone to review your code and say "this will break in production because..."
- A peer who just finished the module you're stuck on
- Accountability to actually finish instead of bouncing to the next tutorial

I'm building a community for that. Skool-based. Focused on builders doing this capstone.

What happens inside:
- Peer code review on every module checkpoint
- Weekly office hours where we debug real infrastructure together
- Advanced challenges (multistage pipelines, canary deployments, blue-green strategies)
- Direct access to me for architecture questions

I'm looking for founding members. The people who join now shape what this becomes.

Or if you're not ready for that, just keep building. The repo isn't going anywhere.

Reply with where you're at. I want to know.
